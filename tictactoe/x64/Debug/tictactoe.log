Tic Tac Toe Game in SFML
Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, developed in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). It features a graphical interface where players can interact with the game using mouse clicks to place their 'X's and 'O's on the game board.

Features
Graphical user interface using SFML.
Support for mouse input to select the cells on the Tic Tac Toe grid.
Dynamic handling of player turns and game state.
Visual feedback for player moves using colored 'X's and 'O's.
Requirements
SFML 2.x
C++ compiler (C++11 or higher recommended)
Make (optional, for building with a Makefile)
Installation
To run this game, you need to have SFML installed on your system. You can download SFML from SFML's official website.

Building the Game
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Make sure SFML is correctly installed and the compiler can find the SFML headers.

Compile the code. If you are using g++, the command might look something like this:

g++ -o tictactoe main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
Run the compiled executable:


./tictactoe
Usage
After starting the game, a window displaying a 3x3 grid will appear. Players can click on the grid to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') in the corresponding cell. The game alternates turns between the players.
